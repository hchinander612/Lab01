	abstract = {Background
Working despite feeling ill – presenteeism – is a widespread behavioral phenomenon. Previous research has shown that presenteeism is influenced by various work-related and personal factors. It's an illness behavior leading to a range of negative but also positive consequences. Due to coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) pandemic, remote work has become the “new normal” for many employees. But so far, little is known about presenteeism in remote work. This study aims to investigate presenteeism in remote work by looking at the extent of remote presenteeism, differences to presenteeism in on-site work, and associated factors.
Methods
A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Germany with N = 233 participants. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and correlation analysis.
Results
The results reveal that presenteeism is prevalent in remote work x̅ = 4.13 days (Md = 3; D = 2; s = 4.95). A low ability to detach from work (r = -.17; p = .005) and low supervisor support (r = -.14; p = .02) is associated with more remote presenteeism days. Remote working conditions seem to facilitate presenteeism.
Conclusion
This study provides empirical insights into a subject area of great societal relevance. The results show that awareness should be raised for presenteeism in remote work. It should be regarded as a behavior that can be functional or dysfunctional, depending on the individual situation. Supervisor support and detachment should be fostered to help reduce dysfunctional presenteeism. Promotion of health literacy might help remote workers to decide on a health-oriented illness behavior. Further research is vital to analyze to what extent and under which circumstances presenteeism in remote work is (dys)functional and to derive clear recommendations.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has allowed many workers to experience working from home. While in most cases, the transition to work from home was not voluntary, it forced many employees to experiment with new work schedules and new ways of communication. The current paper uses 3057 responses from a national survey to study the reported intended frequency of work from home after the pandemic. A mixed logit model with heterogeneity in the means of random parameters is estimated to gain more insights into the employees’ work from home frequency categories. The model estimation results indicate that in addition to the typical socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, education, income, race and ethnicity, factors such as environmental friendliness, life satisfaction, together with other work-related experiences will determine how often employees will intend to work from home after the pandemic. The model also includes factors relating to workers’ disability and therefore the findings paint an interesting and comprehensive picture about the work from home paradigm in the post pandemic world. Lastly, the study suggests numerous policy implications and recommendations that could leverage the experience with telework brought by the pandemic to formulate inclusive, equitable, and environmentally friendly strategies.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: This article examines the extent to which employees worked from home because of the pandemic, focusing on differentials between people with and without disabilities with implications for cancer survivors.
{METHODS}: We use data on {COVID}-19 from the Current Population Survey over the May 2020 to June 2021 period. We present descriptive statistics and the results from regression and decomposition analysis.
{RESULTS}: While workers with disabilities were more likely than those without disabilities to be teleworking before the pandemic, they were less likely to be teleworking as a result of the pandemic. Differences in the occupational distribution account for most of this difference. People with disabilities experienced relatively more pandemic-related hardships as well, compared to people without disabilities, including a greater chance of not being able to work due to their employer losing business and more difficulty in accessing medical care.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Many people with disabilities benefit from working from home, and the pandemic has increased employer acceptance of these arrangements, but the potential is limited by the current occupational distribution.
{IMPLICATIONS} {FOR} {CANCER} {SURVIVORS}: While the {CPS} dataset does not have information on cancer survivorship, we use other data to impute that the average likelihood of cancer survivorship is 12.6\% among people with disabilities, more than double the 6.1\% rate among those without a disability. Hence cancer survivorship is partly picked up by the {CPS} questions on disability, and our results have implications for cancer survivors, especially because increased opportunities for telework have the potential to help cancer survivors maintain economic stability and avoid financial hardship.},

The rapid rise of remote work also affected local life and many employers introduced or extended their telework activities because of the associated advantages. However, despite the evident positive benefits, some employees were pressured to work remotely while ill. This evidence brought new challenges to the presenteeism literature. This article investigates how individual, economic/societal, and organizational/sectorial/supervisory-related variables can moderate the role of a contagious disease, such as the {COVID}-19, in explaining presenteeism behavior. Moreover, the current research presents a multi-level conceptual model (i.e., organizational, individual, supervisory factors) to describe how a new construct of remote-work presenteeism behavior mediates the relationship between different post pandemic health conditions (e.g., allergies, back pain, depression, anxiety) and future cumulative negative consequences. The authors suggested that the widespread pervasive adoption of remote work because of {COVID}-19 has important implications for the presenteeism literature and opens avenues for further research.},

We label this phenomenon “workahomeism” and develop theory that shows its distinctness from traditional presenteeism through the evoked pattern of guilt. Across three studies (a vignette experiment, a critical incident study, and a within-person intervention study), we tested whether employees' work-related reactions to illness (i.e., workahomeism, presenteeism, and resting at home) differ in terms of experienced and anticipated guilt. We found that when employees considered engaging in workahomeism, they anticipated feeling less guilty than when resting at home. However, when employees actually engaged in workahomeism, they felt as guilty or even more guilty than when resting at home. In contrast, employees' anticipated guilt for presenteeism as compared to workahomeism changed from the same to more after the beginning of the {COVID}-19 crisis. Furthermore, we identify facets of guilt in response to workahomeism (i.e., guilt toward colleagues and about own health) and demonstrate that organizations can change guilt patterns by asking employees to reflect on the consequences of workahomeism and presenteeism.},

We draw on survey data collected in October 2020 from a nationally representative sample of 3,017 remote workers, as well as qualitative survey data collected from 231 remote workers, to examine perceived changes in work hours from before to during the pandemic. Results indicate women are at greater risk of change (either a major decrease or a major increase)—rather than stability—in work hours. Gender also intersects with caregiving, race/ethnicity, prior remote work experiences, and socioeconomic status to shape changes in hours. Women and men in the sandwich generation, as well as women (but not men) with pre-school children, are the most likely to report a decrease in work hours, whereas women with older children at home or caring for adults (but not both) are the most likely to have an increase in hours. Remote working Black women and women moving into remote work are more likely to experience a major increase in hours worked, even as Hispanic women and Black men are the most likely to report somewhat of a reduction in work hours. Gender also intersects with {SES}, such that women without a college degree are more likely to have a decrease in work hours, while women with an advanced degree and women managers report a considerable increase in work hours. Qualitative data further illuminate why work hours change or remain stable for remote workers during {COVID}-19.},

Findings revealed that employees working in Iasi are prone to absent as a result of attitudinal factors, in particular, autonomy linked to decision making.

First, due to the variety of existing definitions, competing understandings, as well as the notion of positive presenteeism, it is important to reconsider the notion of presenteeism. Second, it is important to reflect on the measurement of the act of presenteeism and the productivity loss associated with that. Third, following the call to investigate presenteeism in specific contexts, it is important to explain the social, occupational, cross-cultural aspects, as well as the contemporary workplace changes.
